Soul Save Editor
================

This program can edit content from the game's savedata file. For PC or PS3.

When opening a file, the program will consider its extension: if it's .dat,
then it assumes the savedata file is from PS3, anything else will be treated
as PC.

Currently editable items:
- playable characters;
- playable stages;
- cosmo points.

------------------------------------------------------------

Tested PS3 versions: Europe (BLES02291), Japan (BLJS10315).

It can only work with decrypted savedata.

Suggested tool for save decryption is Bruteforce Save Data:
 - decrypt savedata with Bruteforce Save Data;
 - open savedata in Soul Save Editor;
 - edit whatever you want;
 - save the edited savedata;
 - re-encrypt savedata with Bruteforce Save Data.

------------------------------------------------------------

On PC, the savedata is not encrypted at all.

Path to savedata file:
«Steam folder»\userdata\«user number»\348710\remote
