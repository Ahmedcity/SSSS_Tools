TDB Reader
==========

This program can be used to retrieve text from TDB files.

In all versions of the game, the following languages are included: Japanese, English, French, Italian, Spanish (twice - Lantin American and European), Portuguese and Chinese.

TDB files can be found in "resource\text" and are compressed with "CRILAYLA".

I found this source code via Google:

And my version of the compiled decompressor:

TDB Reader can only handle uncompressed files.
